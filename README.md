# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

I have included some scripts of differernt data structures and algorithms that I have coded in Python as an exercise for an online course I have taken in Udemy. These Python scripts could be generelized in three categories: i) data structures, ii) sorting algorithms and iii) graph algorithms. I will add more algorithms when I get the chance to code them.
